	1)	it tries to segment the current bounding box with a version of watershed based on the YCrCb color space,
		then it computes a binary image from the oringinal image using a threshold defined in the YCrCb color space,
		then it computes the intersection of these 2 results,
		then it computes the (number of white pixels of the final mask)/(number of total pixel of the mask)
		if the result of this operation is < 0.32 it passes to point 2), otherwise it keeps the current mask as final mask
	2)	it tries to segment the current bounding box with a version of watershed based on Otsu thresholding,
		then it computes a binary image from the oringinal image using a Otsu threshold,
		then it computes the intersection of these 2 results,
		then it computes the (number of white pixels of the final mask)/(number of total pixel of the mask)
		if the result of this operation is < 0.32 it passes to point 3), otherwise it keeps the current mask as final mask
	3)	it tries to segment the current bounding box with a version of watershed based on the HSV color space,
		then it computes a binary image from the oringinal image using a threshold in the HSV color space,
		then it computes the intersection of these 2 results,
		then it computes the (number of white pixels of the final mask)/(number of total pixel of the mask)
		if the result of this operation is < 0.32 it passes to point 4), otherwise it keeps the current mask as final mask
	4)	it tries to segment the current bounding box with K-means,
		then it computes the (number of white pixels of the final mask)/(number of total pixel of the mask)
		if the result of this operation is < 0.32 it passes to point 5), otherwise it keeps the current mask as final mask
	5)	if none of the masks obtained a value >= 0.32 it keeps the mask that obtained the biggest value
