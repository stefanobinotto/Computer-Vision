//function that, given the bounding boxes of 2 images, returns the values of IoU
//this functions solves the following 2 problems:
//	1) What if, for a given test image, our network finds a number of bounding boxes lower or greater than the number of bounding boxes of the test dataset?
//			(if number of predicted bounding boxes < number of true bounding boxes)
//					----> returns one value of IoU for each predicted bounding box and 0.0 for each non predicted bounding box that is in the ground truth
//			(if number of predicted bounding boxes > number of true bounding boxes)
//					----> returns one value of IoU for each predicted bounding box and 0.0 for the extra bounding boxes
//	2) Which of the test bounding boxes a predicted bounding box corresponds to?
//		---> By defining the origin of a Bounding Box as its top left vertex, a predicted Bounding Box corresponds to the test Bounding Box with minimum distance between their origins
//INPUT PARAMETERS: 2 vectors of bounding box; each one contains all the bounding boxes of an image
//OUTPUT: a vector of Intersection over Union values
